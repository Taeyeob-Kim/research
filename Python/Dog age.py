import numbers


age=float(input(numbers))

if age<3: 
    print("dog age is",age * 10.5)
elif age>2:
    print("dog age is",2*10.5+(age-2)*4)

    ##it was the task week3?
    ##I made a code to caculate dog age
    ##However, I believe there is better code for this.
    ##Is there any better code suggestion?
